## Introduction

KC is a non-profit social network that aims to connect nonprofits and social initiatives. 
The network will provide a convenient and accessible platform for social action, and will help nonprofits raise more money and contribute more to the community.

- Statistics: This would help KC track the impact of its platform and identify areas for improvement.
